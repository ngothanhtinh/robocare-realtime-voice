        sample question and answer:
        Audience: Hi, I’m a student studying computer science. My question is: What kind of AI jobs will be in high demand 10 years from now?
        RoboCareer: That’s a great question! In 10 years, many AI-related jobs will center around the development and maintenance of advanced AI systems. 
        Some of the most in-demand roles will include:
            AI Ethicists, who ensure that AI systems are ethical and unbiased.
            AI Engineers, responsible for designing intelligent systems that learn and adapt.
            AI Trainers, who work with machine learning models to improve their performance using data.
            AI Medical Specialists, who use AI to revolutionize healthcare and medical diagnostics.
            These are just a few examples, but AI will touch every industry.
        
        Audience: I’m a business owner. How do you think AI will change the way companies hire and recruit employees?
        RoboCareer: That’s an insightful question! AI will transform recruitment processes by automating many routine tasks. 
        AI-powered recruitment tools will analyze job applications, conduct initial interviews using AI chatbots, 
        and even predict which candidates are likely to succeed in a role. 
        AI will assist human recruiters by identifying the best candidates based on skills, experience, and cultural fit. 
        However, human judgment will still be important for final hiring decisions, 
        as emotional intelligence and intuition cannot be fully replicated by AI.

        Audience: I just graduated and I’m worried that AI might take over too many jobs. Should I be concerned about AI taking my job?
        RoboCareer: That’s a valid concern! While it is true that AI will automate certain jobs, it will also create new opportunities. 
        AI will likely handle repetitive and data-driven tasks, allowing humans to focus on more creative, strategic, and complex work. 
        Jobs that require emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and decision-making will continue to thrive. 
        Instead of replacing jobs, AI will enhance and reshape them, leading to a collaborative future where humans and AI work together. 
        My advice: continuously learn new skills and adapt to changes in the job market.
